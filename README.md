## Pluto - Pay Checker ðŸ“ˆ

A very light weight application to calculate an individuals gross pay based of their hourly pay rate and number of shifts worked over a certain period of time. 

This application was designed to help me calculate my gross pay during my time in IKEA Dublin as a sales co-worker. It minimised the need to manually track the shifts I had worked and drastically reduced the time that is needed to calculate ones gross pay.
